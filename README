Hi, thank you for checking the code. This .txt file is designed to help you navigate my work.

1. There are 3 main files: 
    a. 1_input: raw data downloaded from NLS Navigator
    b. 3_output: graph, txt file output for LaTeX
    c. 4_int: processed data, for use later
2. All codes are in the 3 rmd files, with the analysis output and the result presented in the thesis.
  The other two initially process and clean the data
3. All rmd files are self-contained: i.e. the environment and the order of running the code do not matter.
4. You do NOT need to paste your local address into any file to run, as I have set up the 2_NLS.RProj, which anchors your paths.
5. There are graphs from old analysis results in the 3_output
