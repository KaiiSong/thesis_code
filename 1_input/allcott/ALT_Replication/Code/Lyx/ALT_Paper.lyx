\begin_layout Abstract
A common objection to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin taxes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

—corrective taxes on goods that are thought to be over-consumed, such as
 cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary drinks—is that they often fall disproportionate
ly on low-income consumers.
 This paper studies the interaction between corrective and redistributive
 motives in a general optimal taxation framework and delivers empirically
 implementable sufficient statistics formulas for the optimal commodity
 tax.
 The optimal sin tax is increasing in the price elasticity of demand, increasing
 in the degree to which lower-income consumers are more biased or more elastic
 to the tax, decreasing in the extent to which consumption is concentrated
 among the poor, and decreasing in income effects, because income effects
 imply that commodity taxes create labor supply distortions.
 Contrary to common intuitions, stronger preferences for redistribution
 can 
\emph on
increase
\emph default
 the optimal sin tax, if lower-income consumers are more responsive to taxes
 or are more biased.
 As an application, we estimate the optimal nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened
 beverages, using Nielsen Homescan data and a specially designed survey
 measuring nutrition knowledge and self-control.
 Holding federal income tax rates constant, our estimates imply an optimal
 federal sugar-sweetened beverage tax of 1 to 2.1 cents per ounce, although
 optimal city-level taxes could be as much as 60% lower due to cross-border
 shopping.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large literature in behavioral economics suggests that biases such as
 self-control problems, inattention, and incorrect beliefs can lead to over-cons
umption of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin goods
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 such as cigarettes, alcohol, unhealthy foods, and energy-inefficient durable
 goods.
 Consumption of these goods can also generate externalities in the form
 of health care costs or pollution.
 Consequently, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin taxes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that discourage consumption of such goods could increase social welfare.
 This argument has led to widespread taxation of cigarettes and alcohol,
 as well as newer taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages in seven U.S.
 cities and 34 countries around the world (GFRP

 This principle, however, assumes that consumers do not vary in their marginal
 utility of money, and thus that policymakers care equally about the poor
 versus the rich.
 This assumption is starkly out of sync with public debates about sin taxes.
 As highlighted by the above quote from Senator Bernie Sanders, a common
 objection to sin taxes is that they are regressive.

In response to such objections, however, others argue that the harms caused
 by overconsumption from behavioral biases are themselves regressive, so
 a corrective tax might confer greater benefits on the poor than the rich.
 For example, smoking and sugary drink consumption cause lung cancer, diabetes,
 and other health problems that disproportionately affect the poor.

\begin_layout Standard
This paper presents a general theoretical model delivering the first explicit
 formulas for an optimal commodity tax that accounts for each of the three
 central considerations in such policy debates: correction of externalities
 and/or consumer bias, regressivity, and revenue recycling.
 We then use the theoretical formulas to estimate the optimal nationwide
 tax on sugar-sweetened beverages using new data and empirical techniques
 to estimate elasticities and biases.

Our theoretical model in Section

 extension of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 by considering an economy of consumers with heterogeneous earning abilities
 and tastes who choose labor supply and a consumption bundle that exhausts
 their after-tax income.
 The policymaker chooses a set of linear commodity taxes and a nonlinear
 income tax, which can be used to provide transfers to poor consumers, to
 raise money for commodity subsidies, or to distribute commodity tax revenue
 (in a progressive way, if desired).
 Unlike those models, however, we allow for a corrective motive of taxation,
 driven by externalities or internalities from consumer mistakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our theoretical results fill two gaps in the literature.
 First, even in the absence of internalities or externalities, there was
 no known general formula for optimal commodity taxes in the presence of
 nonlinear income taxation and preference heterogeneity.

 As a result, tax economists' policy recommendations have relied on the
 canonical result of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) that commodity tax rates
 should be uniform.
 This extreme result, however, requires a homogeneous preferences assumption
 that is likely unrealistic in many settings—and which we show is strongly
 rejected in the case of sugary drinks.
 Second, there has been no general account of how redistributive motives
 and behavioral biases jointly shape optimal commodity taxes.
 Although this is not the first paper to study internality-correcting commodity
 taxes, it is the first to embed internalities in the dominant optimal taxation
 framework of public economics, allowing for redistributive motives and
 a nonlinear income tax, as well as commodity taxes.
 Most previous papers studying internality taxes abstract from redistributive
 motives.
 Those that do not (such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 commodity tax revenue has to be distributed lump-sum and cannot, for example,
 be spent on transfers to the poor or programs that benefit the poor.

The second term in our optimal commodity tax formula represents the

corrective motive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the desire to reduce over-consumption arising from internalities and externali
ties by imposing taxes on harmful goods.
 To incorporate internalities, we follow the sufficient statistics approach
 to behavioral public finance (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp*
key "Farhi2015,chetty2015,Mullainathan2012"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) by adopting a money-metric definition of bias, which can transparently
 accommodate many specific behavioral biases and lends itself to direct
 empirical quantification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The price elasticity of demand determines the relative importance of the
 corrective versus redistributive motives.
 High demand elasticity implies a large change in sin good consumption for
 a given degree of redistribution, and thus that the effects of the tax
 are primarily corrective rather than redistributive.
 Conversely, low demand elasticity implies that the effects of the tax are
 mostly redistributive rather than corrective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the conventional wisdom that inequality aversion unambiguously
 reduces optimal taxes on sin goods heavily consumed by the poor, we show
 that it can either decrease or increase the optimal sin tax.
 Although inequality aversion does magnify the redistributive motive, pushing
 toward a lower sin tax, it also amplifies the corrective motive when poor
 consumers are relatively more biased or more elastic, which pushes toward
 a higher sin tax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key contribution of our theoretical work is that it delivers formulas
 for optimal commodity taxes as a function of sufficient statistics that
 can be estimated in a wide variety of empirical applications.
 In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Estimation"

\end_inset

, we apply the theory by estimating the necessary statistics for the optimal
 nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (hereafter, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

SSBs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 We use Nielsen Homescan, a 60,000-household, nationally representative
 panel dataset of grocery purchases, and Nielsen Retail Measurement Services
 (RMS), a panel dataset from 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input

 grocery purchases.
 A plot of the Homescan data in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SSB_Income"

\end_inset

 illustrates how SSB taxes could be regressive: households with annual income
 below $10,000 purchase about 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/kg_Purchased_lowestIncome.tex"

\end_inset

liters of SSBs per adult each year, while households with income above $100,000
 purchase only half that amount.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify the price elasticity of demand, we develop an instrument that
 exploits retail chains' idiosyncratic pricing decisions for the UPCs that
 a household usually buys at the retailers where the household usually buys
 them.
 For example, if Safeway puts Gatorade on sale, people who often buy Gatorade
 at Safeway face a lower price for their SSBs compared to people who don't
 buy Gatorade and/or don't shop at Safeway.
 We ensure that the instrument is not contaminated by local or national
 demand shocks by using the retailer's average price charged outside of
 a household's county, and by using only deviations from each UPC's national
 average price.
 Because retailers regularly vary prices independently of each other while
 keeping prices fairly rigid across their stores

 We find that both of these bias proxies are strongly associated with SSB
 purchases.
 For example, households in the lowest decile of nutrition knowledge purchase
 more than twice as many SSBs as households in the highest decile.
 Furthermore, the distribution of these proxies suggests that bias may be
 regressive.

 In our baseline specification, the optimal federal-level SSB tax is 
\begin_inset CommandInset include

cents per ounce, or 
\begin_inset CommandInset include

percent of the quantity-weighted average price of SSBs recorded in Homescan.
 For a broad range of specifications, the optimal federal SSB tax lies in
 the range of

 Our preferred estimates imply that the welfare benefits from implementing
 the optimal tax are between $

\begin_inset CommandInset include

billion per year.
 Although SSB consumption is highly concentrated among low earners, the
 overall welfare effects are distributed much more evenly across incomes,
 since our estimates imply that the internality corrections are also greatest
 at low incomes.
 The welfare gains are about $
\begin_inset CommandInset include

million per year higher than what would be realized by imposing a one cent
 per ounce federal tax—currently the modal policy among U.S.
 cities that have implemented SSB taxes.
 After adjusting for the estimated cross-border shopping induced by recent
 city-level taxes, however, we estimate that the optimal city-level tax
 could be as low as 0.53 cents per ounce, which is lower than the current
 modal policy.
 Finally, we emphasize the importance of accounting for behavioral biases
 when designing policy: a tax designed without accounting for behavioral
 biases foregoes nearly $

We begin with a conventional static optimal taxation setting: consumers
 have multidimensional heterogeneous types

\end_inset

, distributed with measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\theta)$
\end_inset

 They supply labor to generate pre-tax income 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, which is subject to a nonlinear tax 
\begin_inset Formula $T(z)$
\end_inset

 Net income is spent on a two goods: a numeraire consumption good 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

 and a

sin good
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, with pre-tax price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, which is subject to a linear commodity tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the consumer's budget constraint is 
\begin_inset Formula $c+(p+t)s\le z-T(z).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each consumer chooses a bundle

\begin_inset Formula $U$

 is assumed to be increasing and weakly concave in its first two arguments,
 and decreasing and strictly concave in the third.
 Decision utility may differ from

normative utility
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $V(c,s,z;\theta)$

 and free from behavioral biases.
 Sin good consumption also generates a fiscal cost to the government of
 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 per unit of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 consumed.
 Pecuniary fiscal externalities are a natural case for sin goods such as

The difference between

 can capture a variety of different psychological biases.
 For example, consumers may have incorrect beliefs about certain attributes
 of

 Finally, present focus may lead consumers to underweight the future health

 Our framework allows us to treat present focus as a bias.
 However, our framework also allows us to study other welfare criteria that

social marginal welfare weights

—the social value (from the policymaker's perspective) of a marginal unit

 produce identical behavior (and identical choice-based measures of bias)
 up to monotonic transformations, the social marginal welfare weights reflect
 a policymaker's or society's normative preference for reducing wealth inequalit

 As in the rest of the optimal taxation literature, our formulas for optimal
 taxes will thus depend both on observable behavior (and people's quantifiable

Our Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We derive an expression for the optimal sin tax using variational calculus
 arguments.
 This generates a first-order (necessary) condition for the optimal sin
 tax in terms of empirically estimable sufficient statistics and social
 marginal welfare weights.
 These statistics are themselves endogenous to the tax system, and so this
 expression should not be understood as a closed-form expression for the
 optimal tax.
 However, to the extent that these statistics are stable around modest variation
s in tax policy, we can approximate the optimal tax by evaluating the statistics
 at the current tax policy.
 In Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:simulations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we calibrate two different structural models that account for the endogeneity,
 and we show that the resulting optimal taxes are very close to those computed
 using estimates of the sufficient statistics at the current tax system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before formally defining the elasticity concepts and presenting the optimal
 tax formula, we briefly summarize the core economic forces that correspond
 to our elasticity concepts and that feature in the formula.
 Intuitively, any variation in the sin tax has three main effects.
 First, a higher sin tax has a direct (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mechanical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) effect on government revenue and on consumers' post-tax incomes.
 The social welfare consequences of this effect depend on the marginal value
 of public funds, and on whether the increased tax burden is shouldered
 more by those with higher or lower marginal utility of money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, an increase in the sin tax leads to substitution away from the sin
 good, which reduces the revenue collected from taxing the sin good.
 In the absence of externalities or internalities, the envelope theorem
 implies the loss in sin tax revenues is the only consequential effect.
 In the presence of externalities and/or internalities, the behavior change
 is beneficial because it reduces externalities from consumption, and because
 consumers now consume less of a good that they have been overconsuming.
 The internality correction benefits are highest when the consumers with
 the highest biases are also most elastic to the sin tax.
 Moreover, when the low-income consumers are the most responsive and/or
 the most biased, the internality benefits of behavior change have the additiona
l virtue of being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Third, the sin tax could affect consumers' labor supply decisions.
 Imagine that the sin good is a normal good, so that if a consumer chooses
 to earn more, she consumes more of the sin good.
 In this case, increasing the sin tax indirectly increases the marginal
 tax burden from choosing higher earnings.
 This disincentive for higher labor supply would then lead to lower income
 tax revenue.
 The converse holds for inferior goods.
 Consequently, when the consumption of a sin good is decreasing with income,
 it is crucial to determine whether this is because it is an inferior good,
 or because preferences for this good are negatively correlated with earnings
 ability.

This potential earnings response may substantially affect the optimal sin
 tax even if consumers spend only a small share of their budget on the sin
 good.
 Intuitively, what matters is the change in earnings due to the sin tax

as a share of expenditures on the sin good
\emph default
—and that share may be substantial even if spending on the sin good is small.
 This channel of behavioral response is the foundation for the classic

There are also higher order effects that are present in the general formula
 in the appendix that are negligible under the simplifying assumptions we
 make in our main theoretical result.
 These include considerations such as the fact that changes in labor supply
 can also affect consumption of the sin good through the income effects
 channel, and that at a given income level there may be a covariance between
 income effects and internalities.

A change in net earnings may come from either a change in labor supply or
 a change in non-labor income (e.g., due to a tax level reduction).
 If sin good consumption and labor are weakly separable in the utility function,
 sin good consumption will respond identically to either type of change
 in earnings.
 In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\eta(\theta)}{p+t}\cdot\frac{z(\theta)}{s(\theta)}(1-T'(z(\theta)))$
\end_inset

 More generally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 quantifies the sin good response to an increase in earnings 
\emph on
from labor
\emph default
, for example due to a local reduction in marginal income tax rates.
 Weak separability implies that the change of

 with response to income shock 
\begin_inset Formula $dz$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ds}{dz}$

 comes from a change in hours or nonlabor earnings, and so the estimated

 will be insensitive to the inclusion of controls for hours worked.
 Using this test, we find support for weak separability in our empirical

One question that arises here is the relevant time horizon for income effects,
 since preferences may themselves be endogenous to income over long periods.
 For example, consumption patterns of children in poor households—including
 those causally driven by low income—may affect their preferences later
 in life, even if their income has increased.
 Conceptually, the relevant statistic for the optimal tax formula is the
 labor supply distortion generated by the commodity tax, which is proportional
 to the income effect on that commodity, measured over the 
\emph on
same time horizon as labor supply decisions
\emph default
.
 Therefore, to the extent that preferences are endogenous to income patterns
 at longer horizons than labor supply decisions, these should be treated
 as preference heterogeneity rather than income effects.
 In practice, our empirical estimates of income effects will be estimated
 using annual income variation.

LatexCommand eqref

 shows that the optimal tax is the combination of two main terms.
 The first term, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}(1+\sigma)+e$
\end_inset

, corresponds to the corrective motive of the tax, and rises with both the
 negative externality 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and internality (average marginal bias) 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

.
 The latter is scaled by 
\begin_inset Formula $1+\sigma$
\end_inset

, illustrating a key difference between externalities and internalities:
 the magnitude of correction for internalities—but not externalities—depends
 on whether the bias is bigger for the rich or the poor, and on whether
 the rich or the poor have more elastic demand.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This asymmetry is not an artifact of the assumption that externalities fall
 on the government's budget.
 We could alternatively allow for more flexible externalities which are
 nonlinear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 and heterogeneous across agents, reducing each consumer's net income by
 a type-specific amount 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\bar{s})$
\end_inset

.
 Then the consumer's budget constraint in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:ic constraints"

\end_inset

 would instead be written 
\begin_inset Formula $c+(p+t)s\leq z-T(z)-E(\bar{s})$
\end_inset

.
 We can then define 
\begin_inset Formula $e=E'_{\bar{s}}(\bar{s})$
\end_inset

, and the optimal tax formulas in Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

caps "false"

\end_inset

 remain the same.
 That is, under heterogeneous externalities one should set the externality
 correction equal to the average marginal externality; however, there is
 no covariance with individual demand elasticity or the level of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 consumption, as is the case with internalities.

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, the internality costs from an consumer's overconsumption fall
 back on that consumer, so they are scaled by the consumer's social marginal
 welfare weight.
 In contrast, the externality generated by any given consumer's consumption
 is borne by the whole population, and thus receives the same weight regardless
 of whose consumption generates it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second term, proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov\left[g(z),s_{pref}(z)\right]$
\end_inset

, corresponds to the redistributive motive of the tax.
 This term depends on the extent to which sin good consumption acts as a
 tag for ability.
 As a result, it depends on the covariation of welfare weights with only
 that component of consumption which is driven by preference heterogeneity.
 Intuitively, this term represents the power of the sin tax to accomplish
 redistribution which cannot already be achieved via income taxation.
 The importance of this term relative to the corrective component depends
 on how responsive consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 is to the tax: the more consumer behavior responds to the tax, the less
 important the redistributive motive relative to the corrective motive.

The income tax formula is a slight modification of

 affects consumption of the sin good through the channel of changing consumers'
 earnings.

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\begin_layout Standard
The optimal tax formula in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:t opt 1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 has a number of special cases which illustrate important insights about
 the forces governing the optimal tax.
 We highlight three special cases of particular interest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Special Case 1: No inequality aversion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If social marginal welfare weights are constant (implying the policymaker
 has no desire to redistribute marginal resources from high to low income
 consumers), then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t=\bar{\gamma}+e.\label{eq:no inequality aversion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This matches the core principal of Pigouvian taxation and the typical sin
 tax results in the behavioral economics literature (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt*
key "ODonoghue2006,Mullainathan2012,Allcott2014,Allcott2015"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 This special case obtains either if welfare weights are constant across
 incomes (e.g., if 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

) or if there is no income inequality (so that all consumers have the same
 marginal utility of consumption).
 In both cases, the optimal commodity tax must exactly offset the average
 marginal bias plus the externality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Special Case 2: No (correlated) preference heterogeneity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When differences in consumption are due purely to differences in income,
 regressive consequences of a sin tax can be perfectly offset by modifications
 to the income tax.
 Equivalently, all feasible distribution can be carried out most efficiently
 through the income tax itself, and the redistributive motive in Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:t opt 1 alt"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is zero.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $s'_{pref}(z)=0$
\end_inset

 need not imply that preferences for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 are homogeneous; only that they are not correlated with earnings ability.
 This special case corresponds to Assumption 3 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Saez2002a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, who shows that the Atkinson-Stiglitz result continues to hold under this
 assumption.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Therefore in this case the optimal sin tax is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t=\bar{\gamma}\left(1+\sigma\right)+e.\label{cor: income effects-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In contrast to Special Case 1, inequality aversion still plays a role in
 the size of the optimal commodity tax, as reflected by the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 term.
 For a given average marginal bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, a relative increase in the biases or elasticities of low-income consumers
 increases 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and thus increases the social welfare benefit of bias correction.
 When bias and elasticity are constant across incomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>0$
\end_inset

, and the size of the optimal tax will exceed the optimal Pigouvian tax
 that prevails absent any inequality aversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Special Case 3: No corrective concerns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third important special case is when both internalities and externalities
 are equal to zero, so that only distributional concerns are relevant.
 In this case,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{t}{p+t}=-\frac{Cov\left[g(z),s_{pref}(z)\right]}{\bar{s}\bar{\zeta}^{c}}.\label{eq: A-S generalization}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 studies a Ramsey framework in which the income tax is constrained to be
 a lump-sum transfer, and he obtains almost the same expression as Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, except with 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}(z)$

 replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{s}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq: A-S generalization"

\end_inset

 generalizes that result, showing that in the presence of a nonlinear income
 tax, the optimal commodity tax still resembles the familiar inverse elasticity
 rule, with the modification that instead of taxing goods that high-earners
 
\emph on
consume
\emph default
, the planner taxes goods that they 
\emph on
prefer.

\emph default
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq: A-S generalization"

\end_inset

 also generalizes the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem to the case of arbitrary
 preference heterogeneity.
 The Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem itself obtains as a special case of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq: A-S generalization"

\end_inset

 when all variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 consumption is driven by income effects, which then implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}\equiv0$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Further insights and intuition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the three special cases above, there are a few other insights
 from Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:general opt tax"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that relate to results elsewhere in the literature.
 First, Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:t opt 1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 holds when 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}=0$
\end_inset

, which may arise even with non-zero internalities if the consumers who
 over-consume (or under-consume) the good are inelastic to the tax (or subsidy).
 A striking implication of the result then is that when lower-income consumers
 prefer the good more, the optimal sin tax will be negative (a sin subsidy).
 This captures the spirit of a key result of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bernheim2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 about the optimality of subsidizing addictive goods when the marginal utility
 of income is increasing with the consumption of the addictive good.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bernheim2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 over-consumption of the good is a consequence of cue-triggered neural processes
 that render the consumer inelastic to prices, the average bias of consumers
 who are elastic to the tax is zero.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Although the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bernheim2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 result that the sin good should be subsidized is seemingly in stark contrast
 to the sin tax results of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ODonoghue2006"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and elsewhere, our general tax formula clarifies the economic forces that
 lead to each result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second key insight from Proposition 1 involves the role of the demand
 elasticity in governing the relative importance of corrective and redistributiv
e concerns.
 As is evident from Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:t opt 1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, when the demand elasticity grows large, the redistributive motive becomes
 small and the optimal tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}(\bar{g}+\sigma)+e$
\end_inset

, corresponding to Special Case 2 above.
 At the opposite extreme, when the elasticity grows small, the corrective
 motive becomes negligible and the optimal tax approaches the expression
 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq: A-S generalization"

\end_inset

 above.
 More generally, if preference heterogeneity accounts for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 share of the decrease in 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 consumption across incomes, then for a sufficiently low elasticity, the
 optimal tax becomes negative (a subsidy).
 Intuitively, if consumers do not respond to commodity taxes, then such
 taxes become a powerful instrument to enact redistribution through targeted
 subsidies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together, these results show how the price elasticity of demand modulates
 the role of consumer bias in determining both the sign and magnitude of
 the optimal commodity tax.
 Perhaps most importantly, the demand elasticity also provides practical
 guidance on how 
\emph on
sensitive 
\emph default
the optimal tax is to different values of the bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and the externality 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

.
 A lower elasticity dampens the responsiveness of the optimal tax to the
 bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, since the corrective benefits in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:t opt 1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 depend on the products 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\zeta}^{c}\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\zeta}^{c}e$
\end_inset

.
 Simply put, learning that the average marginal bias or the externality
 are $1 per unit higher than previously thought does not imply that the
 optimal tax should increase by 
\begin_inset Formula $\$1$
\end_inset

—the optimal adjustment could be higher or lower, depending on the demand
 elasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:general opt tax"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 clarifies the role of revenue recycling—the possibility of using sin tax
 revenues to offset their regressivity.
 By including a nonlinear income tax, this model allows for tax revenues
 to be redistributed in a means-tested fashion.
 Yet our results also explain why such recycling may not be 
\emph on
optimal
\emph default
.
 If sin good consumption differences are driven by income effects, then
 the sin tax and income tax cause similar labor supply distortions.
 In this case, when a corrective sin tax is implemented, the optimal income
 tax should be jointly reformed to be more progressive, effectively recycling
 sin tax revenues in a progressive manner.
 (This corresponds to Special Case 2 above, and accords with the argument
 behind the quote from Jim Kenney in the introduction.) However, if sin good
 consumption differences are driven by preference heterogeneity, then sin
 good consumption serves as a tag that is useful for redistribution, even
 in the presence of the optimal income tax.
 In this case the optimal sin tax is reduced, in order to effectively subsidize
 the sin good for redistributive reasons relative to the pure Pigovian benchmark.

Tax authorities may not be able to optimize the income tax system at the

 the income tax structure.
 In such cases, the optimal sin tax satisfies the following condition:

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov\left[g(z),s(z)\right]+\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This reflects the fact that under the optimal income tax, the fiscal externalit
y from income adjustments in response to the tax (captured by the term

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 as the residual term.
 The term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the income elasticity 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

 to an increase in the marginal income tax rate.
 The converse obtains when the sin good is an inferior good.

 denote the pre-tax expenditures of the respective goods.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi(\theta):=-\frac{\sum_{n}\frac{dx_{n}(\theta)}{dt}}{\frac{dx_{s}(\theta)}{dt}}$
\end_inset

 to measure how much of the reduction in pre-tax expenditures on 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is reallocated to expenditures on the other sin goods 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 in response to a local increase in the sin tax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We continue to let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 denote the money-metric measures of the bias and externality on 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, respectively, and we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{n}$
\end_inset

 analogously for the other sin goods 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 These measures are hard to compare, however, because each is in units of
 dollars per unit of the respective sin good (e.g., dollars per ounce, dollars
 per pack, etc).
 We therefore convert these to unitless measures by dividing by the pre-tax
 price of the respective sin good: 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}_{s}:=\gamma/p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{e}_{s}:=e/p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}_{n}:=\gamma_{n}/p_{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{e}_{n}:=e_{n}/p_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We then define 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}_{r}(\theta):=\frac{\sum_{n}\tilde{\gamma}_{n}(\theta)\frac{dx_{n}(\theta)}{dt}}{\sum_{n}\frac{dx_{n}(\theta)}{dt}}$
\end_inset

 as the expenditure elasticity-weighted average bias of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, and we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\theta):=\tilde{\gamma}_{s}(\theta)-\varphi(\theta)\tilde{\gamma}_{r}(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 In words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 measures the extent to which consumers over-estimate the value of the marginal
 change in consumption of all sin goods that is induced by an increase in
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Using this definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)$
\end_inset

, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{\gamma}}(z)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 in exact analogue to the single sin good case.
 Finally, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{e}_{r}:=\frac{\sum_{n}\tilde{e}_{n}\frac{d\bar{x}_{n}}{dt}}{\sum_{n}\frac{d\bar{x}_{n}}{dt}}$
\end_inset

 as the expenditure-elasticity-weighted externality for untaxed sin goods
 for the whole population, and we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{e}}:=\tilde{e}_{s}-\frac{\sum_{n}\frac{d\bar{x}_{n}}{dt}}{\frac{d\bar{x}_{s}}{dt}}\tilde{e}_{r}$
\end_inset

 to denote the expenditure-weighted externality, per unit change in pre-tax
 expenditures on 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 Using these definitions, the formula for the optimal commodity tax is analogous
 to that in Proposition

 hold and all sin goods are a small share of the consumers' total expenditures,
 then the optimal commodity tax at any fixed tax is approximated by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t\approx p\frac{\bar{\tilde{\gamma}}(1+\tilde{\sigma})+\bar{\tilde{e}}-\frac{1}{\bar{s}\bar{\zeta}^{c}}\left(Cov\left[g(z),s(z)\right]+\mathcal{A}\right)}{1+\frac{1}{\bar{s}\bar{\zeta}^{c}}Cov\left[g(z),s(z)\right]+\mathcal{A}},

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{T'(z(\theta))}{1-T'(z(\theta))}\zeta_{z}(\theta)s(\theta)\xi(\theta)\right]$
\end_inset

.
 If the income tax is optimal, then the optimal commodity tax is approximated
 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t\approx p\frac{\bar{\tilde{\gamma}}(1+\tilde{\sigma})+\bar{\tilde{e}}-\frac{1}{\bar{s}\bar{\zeta}^{c}}Cov\left[g(z),s_{pref}(z)\right]}{1+\frac{1}{\bar{s}\bar{\zeta}^{c}}Cov\left[g(z),s_{pref}(z)\right]}.\label{eq:t opt substitution}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We provide a proof of this result, as well as a formula for the optimal
 income tax, in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app: substitution to other sins"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The key difference between this formula and the formulas with a single
 sin good is in the construction of the bias and externality variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{e}$
\end_inset

.
 In the absence of cross-price effects, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\bar{\tilde{\gamma}}=p\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\bar{\tilde{e}}=e$
\end_inset

, and thus the formula reduces to our initial result.
 In general, substitution to untaxed sin goods will reduce the total average
 marginal bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 and the average marginal externality 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{e}}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, if the normalized values of bias and externality are all equal
 across the sin goods, and if the cross-price expenditure outflow 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 is equal to 30%, then we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $p\tilde{\gamma}=0.7\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\bar{\tilde{e}}=0.7e$
\end_inset

; that is, the corrective benefits are reduced by 30 percent.
 On the other hand, if untaxed sin goods are complements—for example, if
 drinking lowers inhibitions to smoking or using drugs—then the optimal
 sin tax is higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formula can also be applied to study 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leakage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: cases in which consumers shop outside the jurisdiction to avoid a local
 sin tax.
 In this case, we can think of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as the sin good available across the border, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{r}=\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 is simply the change in demand for the sin good across the border divided
 by the change in demand for the sin good within the taxed jurisdiction.
 Because leakage is typically relevant at the city level but not the national
 level, optimal tax rates will typically be lower for city-level taxes than
 for nationwide taxes.

 about measurement error in the within-household self-reported income variation.
 This is for three reasons: there is likely to be measurement error in self-repo
rted year-to-year changes in household income, there is uncertainty as to
 the time period for which the self-reported incomes apply, and variation
 in income that is not due to variation in labor market conditions is less
 likely to be exogenous to preferences for SSBs.
 However, county income shares some of the same problems, and could in principle
 be correlated with other market prices or consumer preferences.

A key challenge in demand estimation is addressing simultaneity bias: omitted

 First, retail chains vary prices over time in a highly coordinated way
 across their stores: if retailer X is offering Gatorade on sale right now
 in Toledo, it's probably also offering Gatorade on sale in Topeka.
 Second, different chains vary their prices independently of each other
 over time: retailer X's current sale has little relationship to what other
 retailers are doing.

 The leave-out construction guarantees that our instrument is not contaminated
 by store-specific responses to local demand shocks, although in practice
 the leave-out construction makes little difference because price variation
 is so coordinated within chains.
 Differencing out the national average price helps remove responses to national-
level demand shocks that might influence the price of the specific UPC 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, which could still be a concern even after we condition on time fixed effects
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 that soak up shocks to overall SSB demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To construct an instrument for the average SSB price faced by each household,
 we fit the leave-out price deviations 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln p_{krt,-c}$

 to the household's average purchasing patterns.
 Household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin{equation}
Z_{it}=\sum_{k,j\in RMS}\pi_{ijkc}\ln p_{krt,-c}.\label{eq:Z}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Price deviations 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln p_{krt,-c}$
\end_inset

 are only observed at RMS stores, so 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{it}$

 sums only over purchases at RMS stores; approximately 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/RMSPurchaseShare.tex"

\end_inset

percent of SSB purchases are at RMS chains.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{ijkc}$
\end_inset

 is the purchase share across all SSB purchases (at both RMS and non-RMS
 stores), each household's quantity-weighted prices paid 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln p_{it}$
\end_inset

 should vary approximately one-for-one with 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{it}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The exclusion restriction is that the local price instrument 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{it}$

, conditional on the set of controls in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The economic content of this assumption is that when retail chains vary
 prices across weeks and quarters, they do not observe and respond to 
\emph on
chain-specific
\emph default

 One threat to this assumption would be price cuts coordinated with retailer-spe
cific advertising, but retailers do little advertising beyond the newspaper

 alternative instrument constructions and fixed effect controls that address
 other types of regional and city-specific demand shocks.

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exclusion restriction would be violated if chains vary prices in response
 to chain-specific demand shocks.
 For example, retailers might respond to local economic downturns in cities
 where they operate, or to seasonal variation in soft drink demand that
 could vary across warm and cold cities.
 Column 2 addresses these concerns by adding city-by-quarter fixed effects.
 Demand shocks could also vary across chains serving different demographic
 groups, for example if an economic downturn primarily affects low-income
 households that shop at some retailers more than others.
 Column 3 addresses this by allowing the city-by-quarter fixed effects to
 differ for above- versus below-median household income.
 In both columns, the point estimates move slightly but are statistically
 indistinguishable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these control strategies can address demand shocks that are common
 across SSB UPCs, they cannot address UPC-specific demand shocks.
 For example, a warm spring on the east coast might increase demand for
 soft drinks more than it increases demand for bottled coffee.
 If retailers were to recognize and respond to this, then the subgroup of
 east coast households that often buy soft drinks would have a positive
 demand shock and an instrument 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{it}$
\end_inset

 that is correlated with that shock, even conditional on city-by-time fixed
 effects.
 Column 4 addresses this concern by using an instrument constructed with
 deviations from the census region average log price instead of the national
 average log price.
 The estimates are again very similar.
 Thus, for the exclusion restriction to be violated, there must be some
 specific form of endogeneity not addressed by these multiple alternative
 specifications.

 In theory, this can bias our estimates, as high prices are more likely
 to cause zero-purchase observations.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for latent demand that is censored at zero) of the reduced form (thereby

 observation).
 Price elasticity estimates are economically similar and statistically indisting

To measure whether elasticities vary by income, column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 presents estimates of Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 that additionally include interactions with household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's mean income over the years it appears in the sample.
 The interaction with price is not statistically significant, although the
 point estimate suggests that lower-income households are slightly more
 price elastic: the fitted elasticity is 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/PriceElasticity_LowIncome.tex"

\end_inset

at $5,000 household income and 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/PriceElasticity_HighIncome.tex"

\end_inset

at $125,000.
 While low-income consumers are more price elastic in many other product
 markets, SSBs may be different because lower-income households have much
 higher demand; SSB demand 
\emph on
slopes 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ds}{dp}$
\end_inset

 are much steeper at lower incomes.
 The interaction with income is also not statistically significant, although
 the point estimate suggests the intuitive result that SSB purchases are
 less responsive to additional income at higher income levels.
 For the analysis that follows, we use the fitted values from this column
 as household-specific price and income elasticities

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\xi}_{i}$

Substitution to Untaxed Sin Goods

In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:multiple"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we derived the optimal SSB tax when complement or substitute sin goods
 are not taxed.
 A key statistic for that formula is 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

, the share of SSB expenditures that are reallocated to other sin goods
 in response to an SSB tax increase.
 We now estimate that statistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To keep the scope manageable, we first define a set of goods that are both
 unhealthy and plausible substitutes or complements to SSBs.
 We consider all Nielsen product modules averaging more than 15 percent
 sugar content by weight.
 This definition includes everything from the highest-sugar modules (sugar,
 syrups, sweeteners, etc.) down to moderate-sugar modules such as sauces
 (pickle relish, ketchup, etc.) and crackers (graham crackers, wafers, etc.).
 We add diet drinks, because these are likely substitutes even though the
 health harms are uncertain.
 We also add alcohol and cigarettes, which could be substitutes or complements
 to sugary drinks if consumers think of them together as a class of tempting
 pleasures.
 We group these into 12 groups, indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and construct household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

's grams purchased in quarter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_inset Formula $r_{nit}$

\begin_inset Formula $Z_{nit}$
\end_inset

, and feature and display 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}_{nit}$

 analogous to the SSB variables described above.
 We estimate the following regression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln r_{nit}=\tilde{\zeta}\ln p_{it}+\zeta_{n}\ln p_{nit}+\tilde{\xi}\ln z_{ct}+\nu\boldsymbol{f}_{it}+\nu_{n}\boldsymbol{f}_{nit}+\omega_{t}+\mu_{ic}+\varepsilon_{it},\label{eq:SubstitutionPatterns}

instrumenting for 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln p_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln p_{nit}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{it}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{nit}$

Table

 presents results.
 The first three columns present substitute beverages, the next eight columns
 present substitute foods, and the final column of the bottom panel presents
 tobacco.
 The estimated own-price elasticities 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\zeta}_{n}$
\end_inset

 are in a reasonable range between 0.5 and 2.
 Unsurprisingly, we find that SSBs and diet drinks are substitutes.
 Only one of the other 11 groups has a statistically significant cross-price
 elasticity.
 The average of the 12 cross-price elasticities is a statistically insignificant
 
\begin_inset Formula $\input{../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/MeanSubElastb.tex}$
\end_inset

, suggesting that if anything, these other goods are slight complements
 on average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these estimates, we construct an estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 for each household and get the population average, which is

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\frac{dx_{si}}{dt}}=\hat{\zeta}_{i}s_{it}$

 Because the health effects of diet drinks are under debate in the public
 health literature, we construct a second 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}$
\end_inset

 excluding diet drinks (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}\approx\input{../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/varphi2.tex}$
\end_inset

).
 Finally, because diet drinks are the most natural substitute to sugary
 drinks, while the other estimates may simply be imprecise zeros, we construct
 a third 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}$
\end_inset

 with only diet drinks (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}\approx\input{../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/varphi3.tex}$
\end_inset

).
 In the first two cases, the point estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}$
\end_inset

 is negative, meaning that if anything, an SSB tax reduces expenditures
 on these other goods, and accounting for this complementarity will slightly
 increase the optimal SSB tax.
 In the final case, substitution to diet drinks will decrease the optimal
 SSB tax if diet drinks generate internalities and externalities.

Causal Income Effects vs.

 The dark circles on Figure

 repeat the consumption-income relationship from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

; this is now compressed due to an expanded y-axis range.
 The curve at the top of the figure uses the income elasticity estimates
 from column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ElasticityEstimates"

\end_inset

 to predict the causal effects of income increases on the SSB consumption
 of households earning less than $10,000 per year: 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{inc}(z_{d})=\bar{s}(z<\$10,000)\prod_{h=2}^{d}\left(\frac{z_{h}}{z_{h-1}}\right)^{\frac{\hat{\xi}_{h}+\hat{\xi}_{h-1}}{2}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 index income groups.
 Between-income preference heterogeneity is 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}(z)=\bar{s}(z)-s_{inc}(z)$
\end_inset

, the difference between actual consumption and consumption predicted by
 income effects.
 On the graph, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}(z)$
\end_inset

 is thus the vertical difference between the dark circles and the curve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}(z)$
\end_inset

 indicates large between-income preference heterogeneity.
 If all households were exogenously re-assigned to earn the same income,
 households currently making over $100,000 per year would purchase 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input

liters fewer SSBs than households currently making under $10,000 per year.
 This difference is about 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/s_pref_Average.tex"

times average consumption.
 This result that lower-income households have stronger 
\emph on
preferences
\emph default
 for SSBs—regardless of whether they have higher 
\emph on
consumption
\emph default
—means that in the absence of internalities and externalities, a policymaker
 would want to subsidize SSBs.

 of imperfect information.
 All of these papers require the same identifying assumption: that preferences
 are conditionally uncorrelated with measures of informedness.

 The 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bronnenberg-Dube-Gentzkow-Shapiro-2015"

\end_inset

 identifying assumptions may initially seem more plausible because branded
 vs.
 generic drugs are close substitutes, while consumer tastes for SSBs vary
 substantially.
 But if generic drugs are perfect substitutes, then the sophisticated shoppers'
 decisions are not needed to identify consumer mistakes.
 The reason to study sophisticated shoppers is to avoid the assumption that
 generics are perfect substitutes, at which point one must maintain the
 same assumption that sophisticated and unsophisticated shoppers do not
 have heterogeneous preferences for the attributes that differentiate branded
 drugs.

 The process is to use surveys to elicit proxies of bias, estimate the relations
hip between bias proxies and quantity consumed, use that relationship to
 predict the counterfactual quantity that would be consumed if consumers
 instead maximized normative utility, and finally transform the quantity
 difference into dollar units using the price elasticity.

To formalize the approach, recall that money-metric bias

 Column 1 is our primary specification.
 Paralleling the unconditional relationships illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, both nutrition knowledge and self-control are highly conditionally associated
 with lower SSB purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are at least three important reasons to be concerned about this empirical
 strategy, some of which can be partially addressed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:BiasEffects"

\end_inset

.
 First, a central concern is our unconfoundedness assumption.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An alternative approach that would identify the causal effect of nutrition
 knowledge would be to run an information provision field experiment, as
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Allcott2015"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 or the nutrition education interventions reviewed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Vargas2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, this is also an imperfect way to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, as it requires the assumption that the intervention is sufficiently comprehens
ive and well-understood to remove all bias from the treatment group.
 Furthermore, such experiments in practice involve additional challenges
 around demand effects and external validity.
 The finding in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Vargas2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that nutrition information interventions have limited effects could be
 because lack of nutrition knowledge has little impact on purchases, or
 it could be because the interventions were incomplete or easily forgotten.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Our demographics and taste variables are potentially noisy and incomplete
 measures of normatively valid preferences, meaning that unobserved preferences
 might bias the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

.
 To explore this, columns 2-4 illustrate coefficient movement: how the 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

 estimates change with the exclusion of different controls.
 Preferences, income, and education are correlated with both SSB purchases
 and bias proxies, so it is unsurprising that their exclusion increases
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

 in column 2 relative to the primary estimates in column 1.
 Other demographics (age, race, the presence of children, household size,
 employment status, and weekly work hours) and county indicators, however,
 have relatively little effect on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

 in columns 3 and 4.
 This limited coefficient movement in columns 3 and 4 is consistent with
 the idea that unobservables also have limited impacts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

, although this is certainly not dispositive due to the low 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 values 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Oster2017"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second concern is measurement error in the self-control variable.
 For example, survey respondents with different incomes and SSB demands
 might not interpret the response categories (not at all, mostly, etc.) in
 the same way, as highlighted in a related setting by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BondLang2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As another example, respondents might have interpreted the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more often than I should
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 phrasing of the question in different ways that don't necessarily reflect
 bias, e.g.
 that they are optimizing but would aspire to something different in the
 absence of financial or other constraints.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Bias_Interactions"

\end_inset

 presents additional estimates including an interaction term between knowledge
 and self-control.
 This interaction term is highly significant, perhaps because it takes knowledge
 of health damages to believe that one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

should
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consume less.
 Including this interaction in the model, however, does not materially change
 the estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In general, measurement error could bias our estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 up or down.
 One natural model is a type of classical measurement error: noise is uncorrelat
ed with SSB purchases, uncorrelated with income, and uncorrelated across
 different survey responses within the same household.
 In this model, our estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 for self-control in column 1 would attenuated toward zero, but we can recover
 unbiased estimates by instrumenting for self-control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We address measurement error through several sensitivity analyses.
 First, we construct 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 by halving or doubling the 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}$
\end_inset

 coefficient on self-control from column 1.
 Second, column 5 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:BiasEffects"

\end_inset

 simply omits the self-control variable, allowing an estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 that depends only on nutrition knowledge.
 Because knowledge and self-control are positively correlated, the nutrition
 knowledge coefficient is stronger in this column.
 Third, we instrument for self-control using the repeated measurements in
 the households where two heads responded to the PanelViews survey, using
 a two-sample two-stage least squares procedure detailed in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:MeasurementError"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Column 6 presents results.
 Comparing to column 1, we see that the measurement error correction addresses
 what would otherwise be substantial attenuation bias in the self-control
 coefficient.
 We use the results in this column to construct yet another alternative
 estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, which is unbiased under classical measurement error.
 Positive (negative) correlation in measurement error across household heads
 would imply that the column 6 estimates are lower (upper) bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final important concern with the empirical strategy is that we assume
 that our survey measures fully capture the only types of biases that affect
 SSB consumption.
 In reality, our measures may be incomplete measures of all types of imperfect
 knowledge and self-control that could affect SSB consumption.
 Furthermore, if other biases increase SSB consumption—for example, projection
 bias or inattention to health harms—then we could understate the optimal
 SSB tax.
 We chose these two biases and these specific survey questions because we
 thought that these best reflected the most relevant and plausible sources
 of bias.

 it does not apply to people with government-provided health insurance through

 Second, the diseases caused by SSBs might decrease life expectancy, reducing
 the amount of social security benefits that people claim and thereby imposing
 a positive fiscal externality

 We compute the optimal tax across a range of specifications, under two

These computations require an assumption about inequality aversion.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This calculation also provides intuition for the key determinants of the
 optimal tax.
 The denominator is close to one.
 In the numerator, the corrective motive is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}(1+\sigma)+e\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/gammaBar.tex}(1+\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/sigma.tex})+0.85\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/corrective.tex}$
\end_inset

 cents per ounce.
 Less than half of the corrective motive is driven by externality correction,
 as the average marginal bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 is larger than the externality.
 Moreover, the internality correction is further inflated by about 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/sigma100.tex"

\end_inset

percent due to the bias correction progressivity term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, reflecting the fact that the benefits of bias correction accrue disproportiona
tely to poorer consumers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counteracting this corrective motive, the redistributive motive pushes toward
 a smaller optimal SSB tax, because the poor have much stronger preferences
 for SSBs than the wealthy.
 Using Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ManualTable"

\end_inset

, we can calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov[g(z),s(z)]\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/covgs.tex}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{T'(z)}{1-T'(z)}\bar{\zeta}_{z}\bar{s}(z)\bar{\xi}(z)\right]\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/fixedinctaxexpec.tex}$
\end_inset

.
 The first term represents the mechanical distributional effect of the tax
 based on actual SSB consumption, while the second represents the change
 in income tax revenues due to the effect of the SSB tax on labor supply.
 Thus the redistributive motive reduces the tax by about 20 percent relative
 to the pure corrective motive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baseline calculation above holds fixed the status quo income tax.
 If the optimal income tax is allowed to adjust to be optimal, the impact
 of the redistributive motive is instead proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $-Cov\left[g(z),s_{pref}(z)\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This statistic can be computed directly from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ManualTable"

\end_inset

, Panel B, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}(z)$
\end_inset

 is constructed as the difference between observed SSB consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{s}(z)$
\end_inset

 and consumption predicted from estimated income elasticities, similarly
 to Figure

\begin_inset Formula $Cov\left[g(z),s_{pref}(z)\right]\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/covgsPref.tex}$
\end_inset

 Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:general opt tax"

\end_inset

 therefore implies an optimal sin tax of 
\begin_inset CommandInset include

\end_inset

cents per ounce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optimal SSB tax is higher under the status quo income tax than under
 the optimal income tax because under our assumed welfare weights, status
 quo marginal income tax rates are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relative to the optimum.
 Since SSB taxes distort labor supply downward when SSBs are a normal good,
 they create a negative fiscal externality through the income tax.
 That negative fiscal externality is much larger under the optimal income
 tax than under the status quo because the marginal income tax rates of
 the optimal income tax are much larges than those of the status quo.
 Consequently, the optimal SSB tax is lower under the optimal income tax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These estimates of the optimal SSB tax are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 now summarize.

\begin_layout Standard
The second row of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

 reports the optimal tax estimated using self-reported SSB consumption from
 our PanelViews survey, rather than data captured by Homescan.
 This specification results in a higher optimal SSB tax of 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input

cents per ounce.
 (All other rows use the Homescan data used for the baseline calculation.)

\begin_layout Standard
The next three rows consider alternative assumptions about the policymaker's

 The

Pigouvian

\end_inset

 specification reports the optimal tax in the absence of any inequality
 aversion, in which case the tax is simply equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}+e$
\end_inset

.
 We then report the optimal tax under weaker preferences for redistribution,
 which lead to a higher tax than in the baseline specification, since the
 redistributive motive of the tax is weakened.
 (The corrective motive also decreases, due to smaller bias correction progressi
vity, but this is a smaller effect.) Similarly, stronger inequality aversion
 leads to a lower tax than in the baseline.
 In both cases, the deviation from baseline is greater under the optimal
 income tax than under the status quo, for the same reason that the baseline
 SSB tax is lower under the optimal income tax: SSB tax fiscal externalities
 are more costly under stronger redistributive preferences.
 Finally, we consider the assumption that the policymaker's redistributive
 preferences exactly rationalize the observed U.S.
 income tax.
 This assumption implies very weak redistributive motives and social marginal
 welfare weights that are not even everywhere decreasing with income.

Theory predicts that in a continuous model, the optimal SSB tax would be
 the same in the two columns, since the existing U.S.
 income tax is optimal by assumption.
 Under this discretized calculation, the two values differ slightly, but
 they are much closer than under the alternative assumptions about redistributiv
e preferences.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, we are skeptical that the implied redistributive preferences represent
 deep normative judgments—as opposed to political economy constraints or
 other factors—and so we use our more conventionally chosen 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 weights for the other rows of Table

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next consider alternative assumptions about the SSB demand elasticity.
 A higher elasticity scales down the redistributive motive, raising the
 optimal tax.
 Conversely, a lower elasticity reduces the optimal tax.
 The next two rows of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

 report the optimal tax assuming a (constant) demand elasticity of either
 2 or 1, rather than our heterogeneous empirical estimate.
 The following row explores the effect of assuming elasticities decline
 
\emph on
more steeply
\emph default
 with income—there we assume that the interaction term on elasticities and
 household income is four times as large as our estimate from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ElasticityEstimates_IVInc"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, while adjusting the intercept to leave the population average elasticity
 unchanged.
 This raises the optimal tax, through the bias concentration progressivity
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, but the effect is muted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next two rows consider different possible roles of preference heterogeneity
 versus income effects in accounting for cross-sectional variation in SSB
 consumption.
 The first case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pure preference heterogeneity,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 assumes that all SSB consumption differences are driven by between-income
 preference heterogeneity.
 In this case, the optimal SSB tax is independent of the income tax, and
 so it is the same in both columns.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pure income effects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 case instead assumes preferences are homogeneous, implying that SSBs are
 highly inferior goods.
 In this case, redistribution is more efficiently carried out through the
 optimal income tax.
 This does not substantially alter the optimal SSB tax under the (suboptimal)
 status quo income tax.
 If the income tax is optimal, however, then the optimal SSB tax is 
\emph on
higher
\emph default
 than the Pigouvian case of no inequality aversion, as in special case 2
 in Section

The next four specifications report alternative sets of assumptions about
 our internality estimates from limited self control.
 First, we employ a measurement error correction for our estimate of bias
 from self-control, as in Column (6) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:BiasEffects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The measurement error correction raises the estimated bias from self control
 problems, which increases the optimal tax.
 Second, we report the optimal tax assuming consumers have no self control
 problems—that is, assuming bias is driven solely by incorrect nutrition
 knowledge.
 This reduces the optimal tax, relative to our baseline.
 Finally, to reflect the relative uncertainty about the precision of bias
 due to limited self control, we report the optimal tax assuming that bias
 due to limited self control is either one half or twice as large as our
 baseline estimate.

The next five specifications compute the optimal tax accounting for substitution
 patterns across sweetened goods, using the theoretical formula presented
 in Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

caps "false"

 These substitution patterns are based on the estimates reported in Table

 In the specification 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

With substitution: untaxed goods equally harmful,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 we assume each of the categories reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Substitution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is equally harmful to SSBs (in terms of price-normalized externalities
 and internalities).
 Since these other categories of goods are estimated to be slightly complementar
y to SSB consumption on average, accounting for substitution raises the
 corrective motive of the tax, resulting in a higher optimal tax.
 We report analogous exercises on the following two lines, assuming the
 other categories of goods are either half or twice as harmful as SSBs,
 respectively.
 Finally, because diet drinks are the one category that is estimated to
 be a significant substitute for SSBs in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Substitution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we consider two possible assumptions about their role.
 In the specification 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With substitution: diet drinks not harmful,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we assume that diet drinks are unharmful, with no internalities or externalitie
s, while all other categories are as harmful as SSBs.
 Since the other categories (excluding diet drinks) are a stronger complement
 to SSBs as a whole, this assumption implies that the corrective benefits
 of SSB taxes are larger, resulting in a higher optimal tax.
 For a contrasting assumption, we note that the insignificant (or barely
 significant) substitution patterns estimated for goods other than diet
 drinks in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Substitution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 could be due to statistical noise.
 Therefore, the specification 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With substitution: only to diet drinks, equally harmful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we assume that all categories other than diet drinks are neither substitutes

 Since diet drinks are a strong substitute for SSBs, this reduces the corrective
 strength of an SSB tax, resulting in a lower optimal tax rate.

We next consider two more extreme assumptions about internalities and externalit

 The row labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No internality
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 reports the optimal tax if consumer bias is assumed to be zero, which substanti

 The specification

No corrective motive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also assumes that 
\emph on

 In this case, only the redistributive motive is active, resulting in an
 optimal subsidy for SSBs.

Optimal local tax

 As noted in Section

, interpreting cross-border goods as a substitute untaxed good that generates
 identical internalities and externalities.
 Although we focus on the optimal nationwide SSB tax for our benchmark analysis,
 allowing for such leakage may be informative for determining the optimal
 city-level policy.
 There are several existing estimates of leakage.

 We compute the optimal local SSB tax under the assumption that either 25%

 We do not compute these specifications under the optimal income tax, as
 it is unclear what assumption should be made about local income taxes.

For intuition on the magnitudes, consider the efficiency gains from a purely
 corrective tax based on our estimated population-level statistics.
 The sum of the estimated average internality and externality is 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}+e\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/gammaBar.tex}+0.85\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/intplusext.tex}$

 curve is approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\zeta}^{c}\frac{\bar{s}}{p}\approx\input{../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/demandslope.tex}$
\end_inset

 Thus the deadweight loss triangle eliminated by a fully corrective tax
 is approximated by

 cents per week, or $

 The actual welfare gains are somewhat smaller because of redistributive
 considerations.

 This generates $

 These gains from the optimal tax highlight the importance of using empirical

 In the specification using self-reported SSB consumption from the second

The welfare gains can be decomposed into four distinct components, plotted
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 across the income distribution and described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:welfare"

\end_inset

.
 The net gains vary across income groups for two competing reasons.
 First, groups that consume more SSBs have a larger decision utility equivalent
 variation loss due to the financial burden of the tax.
 Second, groups that are more biased and more elastic experience a larger
 benefit from bias correction due to the tax.
 As a result, the profile of net benefits from a seemingly 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regressive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sin tax can be increasing or decreasing with income.
 The former force tends to dominate in our baseline estimate, generating
 an upward-sloping profile of net benefits across the income distribution.
 That slope is modest, however, and a similar exercise using the PanelViews
 self-reports—which give a steeper negative slope of bias in income—suggests
 that the poor benefit nearly as much as the rich; see Appendix Figure

A potential concern about the estimates in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

, and the corresponding welfare calculations, is that our implementation
 of the sufficient statistics formulas yield only an approximation to the
 optimal tax, for two reasons.
 First, our formulas assume that income effects on labor supply and the
 budget share of SSBs are negligible.
 Second, we estimate the statistics at the status quo equilibrium, rather
 than under the optimal tax—that is, we do not account for how a new tax
 regime would change the consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 by income, or how it would affect the elasticities.
 To explore the importance of these sources of error, Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:simulations"

\end_inset

 presents estimates of the optimal tax using two different structural models,
 with taxes computed using sufficient statistics at the optimum and fully
 accounting for all behavioral responses.
 Those estimates exhibit the same qualitative patterns and are quantitatively
 close to the values reported here, particularly in the case where the income
 tax is held fixed, providing additional evidence that an empirically feasible
 implementation of our sufficient statistics formulas provides a close approxima
tion to the optimal tax.

This paper provides a tractable theoretical and empirical framework for
 setting and evaluating optimal commodity taxes in the presence of internalities
 and externalities.
 We provide the first optimal commodity tax formula that takes account of
 the three key elements of public policy debates around sin taxes: correcting
 consumer bias and externalities, distributional concerns, and revenue recycling
 through income taxes or income-targeted transfers.
 Prior work in behavioral economics and public economics has considered
 only subsets of these three issues or imposed unrealistic assumptions around
 preference heterogeneity and other parameters.

We demonstrate the usefulness of the theoretical results by focusing on
 a particularly timely and controversial public policy question: what is
 the optimal soda tax? Our PanelViews survey data provide novel insights
 about the relationship between nutrition knowledge, self-control, income
 and SSB consumption, and we provide a credible estimate of the price elasticity
 of demand for SSBs using a new and broadly usable instrument.
 Our results suggest that externalities and internalities each provide about
 half of the corrective rationale for SSB taxes, highlighting the importance
 of attempting to measure internalities.
 We calculate that the socially optimal nationwide SSB tax is between 
\begin_inset CommandInset include

Although we take seriously the possibility that consumers might make mistakes,
 our methodology fundamentally relies on revealed preference.
 Our methods are designed to identify the choices people would make if they
 were fully informed and consumed sugary drinks as much as they feel they
 actually should.
 In parallel with other work in behavioral public economics, our approach
 allows us to continue to use standard tools of public economics to evaluate
 policies.
 One alternative approach implicit in much of the public health literature
 is to assume that the only social objective is to maximize positive health
 outcomes.
 However, it is difficult to justify why one should ignore all other factors,
 such as the benefits of enjoying sugary drinks.
 A second alternative is to elicit subjective well-being or other measures
 of “experienced utility,” as in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "GruberMullainathan"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 study of the impact of cigarette taxes on smokers' happiness.
 However, this approach is fundamentally retrospective, so it cannot be
 used to evaluate policies that have not yet been implemented.
 A central problem shared by both alternative approaches is that they do
 not generate consumer surplus estimates in units of dollars, which are
 necessary for a comprehensive welfare analysis that also includes producer
 surplus, externalities, government revenue, and redistributive concerns.

Our theoretical results and empirical methodology could immediately be applied
 to study optimal taxes (or subsidies) on cigarettes, alcohol, unhealthy
 foods such as sugar or saturated fat, and consumer products such as energy-effi
cient appliances.
 Leaving aside internalities, our results can be used to clarify active
 debates about the regressivity of externality correction policies such
 as carbon taxes and fuel economy standards.
 Our theory is also applicable to questions about capital income taxation
 or subsidies on saving, and with some appropriate modification our empirical
 methods could be extended to quantify taxes in those domains as well.
 Finally, our theory could be extended in a number of potentially fruitful
 directions, such as allowing for issues of tax salience or incorporating
 endogenous producer pricing and product line choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we discuss throughout the paper, our approach has its weaknesses.
 One should be cautious about advocating any particular optimal tax estimate
 too strongly, and we encourage further work extending, generalizing, and
 critiquing our approach.
 But by leveraging robust economic principles tied closely to data, our
 methods almost surely provide valuable input into thorny public policy
 debates that often revolve around loose intuitions, unsubstantiated assumptions
, personal philosophies, or political agendas.

Notes: Panel (a) presents descriptive statistics on the Nielsen Homescan
 data, which are at the household-by-year level for 2006-2016.
 If there are two household heads, we use the two heads' mean age, education,
 employment status, and weekly work hours.
 We code weekly work hours as zero for people who are not employed.
 For people who are employed, weekly work hours is reported in three bins:
 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

30, 30-34, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

35, which we code as 24, 32, and 40, respectively.
 The U.S.
 government Dietary Guidelines include calorie needs by age and gender;
 we combine that with Homescan household composition to get each household
 member's daily calorie need.
 Household size in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adult equivalents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the number of household heads plus the total calorie needs of all other
 household members divided by the nationwide average calorie need of household
 heads.
 Prices and incomes are in real 2016 dollars.
 Panel (b) presents descriptive statistics on the Homescan PanelViews data,
 with one observation for each respondent.
 See Appendix

Income Elasticity Definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define labor supply responses to include any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

circularities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 due to the curvature of the income tax function, which is assumed to be
 differentiable.
 Thus, following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jacquet2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we define a tax function 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 which has been locally perturbed around the income level 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{0}$
\end_inset

 by raising the marginal tax rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and reducing the tax level by 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{T}(z;z_{0},\tau,\nu):=T(z)+\tau(z-z_{0})-\nu.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{*}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 denote a type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

's choice of earnings under the status quo income tax 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}(\theta;\tau,\nu$
\end_inset

) denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

's choice of earnings under the perturbed income tax 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}(z;z^{*}(\theta),\tau,\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 Then the compensated elasticity of taxable income is defined in terms of
 the response of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\nu=0$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{z}^{c}(\theta):=\left(-\left.\frac{\partial\hat{z}(\theta;\tau,0)}{\partial\tau}\right|_{\tau=0}\right)\frac{1-T'(z^{*}(\theta))}{z^{*}(\theta)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The income tax is similarly defined in terms of the response of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}$
\end_inset

 to a tax credit 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (this statistic will be nonpositive if leisure is a non-inferior good):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{z}(\theta):=\left(\left.\frac{\partial\hat{z}(\theta;0,\nu)}{\partial\nu}\right|_{\nu=0}\right)\left(1-T'(z^{*}(\theta))\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These definitions are comparable to those in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Saez2001"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, except that they include circularities and thus permit a representation
 of the optimal income tax in terms of the actual earnings density, rather
 than the

We can also allow for the possibility that the sin good

 at the optimum.
 Assume all sin goods are subject to a common 
\emph on

 Under this composite setup, the optimal sin tax

Computing the Optimal Tax in Terms of

\begin_layout Standard
Here we solve for the optimal tax system in terms of the social marginal

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key variable needed for this solution is the following: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When we raise the commodity tax by 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

, how much money can we give back to each person to offset the tax so as
 to keep the average labor supply choices of each 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-earner constant?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Roughly, we seek to characterize the extent to which we can offset the
 regressivity costs of the commodity tax by making the income tax more progressi
ve.
 We begin with a lemma providing this characterization:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "lem: chi formula"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(z):=s{}_{inc}(z)-\int_{0}^{z}w(x,z)\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x}(s(x)-s_{inc}(x))dx$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $w(x,z)=\exp\left[\int_{z'=x}^{x'=z}-\frac{\eta_{z}}{\zeta_{z}^{c}z}dx'\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Then increasing the commodity tax by 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 and decreasing the income tax by 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(z)dt$
\end_inset

 leaves the average labor supply of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-earners unchanged.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intuition for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

income effect adjustment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 term is that the higher the income effect, the more the commodity tax increases
 labor supply through the income effect, and thus the higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 can be.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(z)=s_{inc}(z)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{z}=0$
\end_inset

.
 That is, in the absence of labor supply income effects, the term 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{inc}(z)$
\end_inset

—which we defined as the portion of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 consumption explained by income effects—is the extent to which the income
 tax should be optimally lowered for 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-earners.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{z}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{inc}(z)<\bar{s}(z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(z)$
\end_inset

 will be higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{inc}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Intuitively, this is because giving back 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{inc}(z)dt$
\end_inset

 to consumers offsets the effective impact on the marginal keep-rate from
 before-tax earnings, but does not fully offset the income effect as it
 leaves consumers poorer by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $(s-s_{inc})dt$
\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:t opt 1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, with two differences.
 First, the covariance term 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov[g(z),s_{pref}(z)]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{pref}(z)=s(z)-s_{inc}(z)$
\end_inset

, corresponding to regressivity costs is written more generally as 
\begin_inset Formula $E[(g(z)-1),s(z)-\chi(z)]$
\end_inset

.
 In the absence of labor supply income effects, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(z)=s_{inc}(z)$
\end_inset

 and thus the two terms are equivalent.
 Second, the presence of income effects 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 means that a tax reform that decreases consumers' after-tax income by 
\begin_inset Formula $s(z)-\chi(z)$
\end_inset

 also impacts consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, beyond the compensated elasticity with respect to prices.
 This generates fiscal externalities proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $t\eta(s(z)-\chi(z))$
\end_inset

 and additional corrective benefits proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $g\bar{\gamma}(s(z)-\chi(z))$
\end_inset

.
 Combined, this generates the third term in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:general t formula with g's"

\end_inset

 above.
 In the absence of both kinds of income effects it is easy to see that the
 formula reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t=\bar{\gamma}(\bar{g}+\sigma)-\frac{p+t}{\bar{s}\bar{\zeta}^{c}}Cov\left[g(z),s(z)-s_{inc}(z)\right],

\end_inset

which can be solved for

: the reform mechanically reduces each consumer's net income by

 Lemma 1 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Saez2002a"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which carries through in this context: the change in earnings for type
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 due to the increase in the commodity tax 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 is equal to the change in earnings that would be induced by imposing a
 type-specific income tax reform, raising the income tax by 
\begin_inset Formula $dT^{\theta}(z)=dt\cdot s(p+t,z-T(z),z;\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 Intuitively, an increase in the commodity tax alters the utility that type
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 would gain from selecting each possible level of earnings, in proportion
 to the amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 would consume at each income.
 This alternative income tax reform reduces the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 would realize at each possible income by instead altering the income tax.
 The resulting adjustment in earnings can be decomposed into a compensated
 elasticity effect and an income effect.
 The compensated elasticity effect depends on the change in the marginal
 income tax rate, which equals 
\begin_inset Formula $dt\cdot\frac{ds(z;\theta)}{dz}$
\end_inset

.
 (We adopt the shorthand 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ds(z;\theta)}{dz}:=\frac{ds(p+t,z-T(z),z;\theta)}{dz}$
\end_inset

.
 Because this derivative holds type constant, it is different from 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{s}'(z)$
\end_inset

 even with unidimensional types, which also incorporates how types vary
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.) The income effect depends on the change in the tax level, which equals
 
\begin_inset Formula $dt\cdot s(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 Combining these effects, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dz(\theta)}{dt}=-\zeta_{z}^{c}(\theta)\left(\frac{z(\theta)}{1-T'(z(\theta))}\right)\frac{ds(z;\theta)}{dz}-\frac{\eta_{z}(\theta)}{1-T'(z(\theta))}s(\theta)$

\begin_layout Standard
Under condition (b), terms of order

, the income effect terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\xi}$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 go to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{(p+t)s(\theta)}{z(\theta)}\to0$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$

 go to zero.
 Condition (b) further assumes that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{z}$

When we raise the commodity tax by

 to keep the average labor supply choices of each

-earner constant?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Call this quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(z)$
\end_inset

.
 This term satisfies the following differential equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}z\chi'(z)+\eta_{z}\chi(z)=\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}zs'_{inc}(z)+\eta_{z}s(z)\label{eq:alpha(z)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The right-hand side is the impact of the commodity-tax, as shown in Appendix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app: general prop proof"

\end_inset

.
 The left-hand side follows straightforwardly: the first term is just compensate
d effect of increasing the marginal tax rate, while the second term is the
 income effect.
 Rearranging yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi'(z)+\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}z}\chi(z)=s'_{inc}(z)+\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}z}s(z)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The solution to this first-order differential equation is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi(z)=\frac{\int_{x=0}^{z}e^{\int^{x}\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x'}dx'}\left(s'_{inc}(x)+\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x}s(x)\right)dx+K}{e^{\int^{z}\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x'}dx'}}.

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$

 is some integration constant.

\begin_layout Proof

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dx}s_{inc}(x)e^{\int^{x}\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x'}dx'}=e^{\int^{x}\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x'}dx'}\left(s_{inc}'(x)+\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x}s_{inc}(x)\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi(z) & = & s_{inc}(z)+\frac{K-s_{inc}(0)}{e^{\int^{z}\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}z}dx'}}+\int_{0}^{z}w(x,z)\frac{\eta_{z}}{\bar{\zeta}_{z}^{c}x}(s(x))dx

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w(x,z)=e^{\int_{x'=x}^{x'=z}-\frac{\eta_{z}}{\zeta_{z}^{c}z}dx'}$

 Because by Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 this has no effect on labor supply, it has the following impact on welfare:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula

\end{multline}

\end_inset

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 follows from the following effects.
 The first effect is the direct revenue and welfare effect of decreasing
 each consumer's income by 
\begin_inset Formula $s(z)-\chi(z)$
\end_inset

 and transferring that to public funds.
 The second effect corresponds to the compensated demand response, which
 generates both a welfare effect and a fiscal externality from substitution.
 The third effect comes from the effect that a wealth decrease of 
\begin_inset Formula $s(z)-\chi(z)$
\end_inset

 has on 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 consumption; again, this generates both a fiscal externality and a welfare

\begin_layout Proof

Identifying the price elasticity of demand.

 Our instrumental variables approach has advantages relative to alternative
 methods of identifying price elasticity.
 One alternative is to use recent SSB tax changes in U.S.
 cities as an instrument.
 This would require the assumption that no other factors affected SSB demand
 at the time the SSB tax was implemented.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ReesJones2018"

 about sin taxes also affect demand, even in cities where prices never changed
 because the tax never went into effect.

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In our theory model, a tax affects demand only through prices, not through
 signaling or public awareness.
 The tax elasticity of demand estimated in these papers would be one crucial
 input into a richer model.
\end_layout

 Furthermore, because there have been only a small handful of city-level
 SSB taxes implemented in the U.S., this approach will tend to deliver less

, who instrument for the price of a product at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 using the average price of that product in all other cities.
 This requires the assumption that time-varying demand shocks for a given
 product are uncorrelated across cities, which assumes away possibilities
 such as national advertising campaigns.
 Our instrument also delivers more power, because it exploits the extensive
 idiosyncratic chain-specific price variation instead of the more limited
 variation in national average prices.

 With our particular vector of controls, Appendix Table

Long-run versus short-run elasticities
\series default
.
 Because the commodity taxes and income taxes we model are long-lasting,
 we ideally want long-run elasticities to calibrate optimal taxes.
 In the absence of plausibly exogenous long-run price and income variation,
 we estimate the price and income elasticities of demand for SSBs using
 quarterly prices and annual income.
 To the extent that there is habit formation in SSB consumption, this variation
 would cause us to understate elasticities.
 In Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceAndIncomeElasticity_IVLag"

 this does not rule out habit formation over a longer time horizon.

Measuring SSB consumption with scanner data vs.
 self-reports.

\series default
 While purchase data are incomplete for the reasons discussed in the paper,
 self-reported intake data have other limitations that could bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

 up or down.
 For example, self-reports of consumption and self-control could both suffer
 from recency or salience bias: the judgments may be constructed based on
 only the most recent or salient consumption episodes.
 The resulting correlated measurement error would generate an upward-biased
 relationship between self-reported consumption and self-control.
 Additionally, social desirability bias could cause people with more health
 knowledge or less perceived self-control to under-report consumption, which
 could bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$
\end_inset

 either up or down.
 Using scanner-based purchase data avoids these potential problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Homescan's incomplete consumption measures could also affect our price elasticit
y estimate.
 If households substitute between scanned and non-scanned SSBs, for example
 by buying less soda at a restaurant when grocery store prices are lower,
 the estimated price elasticity of scanned purchases will likely overstate
 the true SSB price elasticity.

 assumption in Section

, and others review the possible approaches to estimating biases for public
 policy applications.
 We briefly discuss the merits of these other approaches in the context
 of SSB consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach is to calibrate or estimate models of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bias
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameters.
 For example, in the older working paper version of this paper, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "LockwoodandTaubinsky2017"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 assume that all bias is a consequence of present bias, and use evidence
 from behavioral economics and public health to calibrate a present bias
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and a marginal health cost parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 to arrive to an estimate of bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=(1-\beta)h$
\end_inset

.
 This strategy rests on many assumptions: that measures of present bias
 from laboratory experiments about effort or money can be extrapolated to
 a representative population and to the alternate domain of SSB consumption;
 that the measures of marginal health costs (obtained from mostly correlational
 public health studies) are accurate and independent of the types of SSBs
 purchased; and that bias is homogeneous across the population; and that
 there are no biases besides present bias.
 Preference reversal experiments with groceries such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet*
key "Sadoff2015"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 could be used to provide qualitative within-domain evidence of present
 bias, but such designs do not deliver money-metric bias estimates and would
 be prohibitively difficult to carry out on a nationally representative
 sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mistakes arising from misinformation could also be measured using survey-elicite
d beliefs.
 This approach of eliciting beliefs about health costs is similar in spirit
 to our approach, but unlike our approach requires strong assumptions about
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 marginal health costs as well as reasonably strong structural assumptions
 about how health costs affect decision and normative utility.
 Furthermore, consumers may or may not act on the beliefs that they state
 in a survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, one might estimate informational and attentional biases through
 an information provision field experiment, as we discuss in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:BiasEffects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This strategy requires the assumption that the information provided fully
 debiases the information treatment group, which could be unrealistic in
 the case of complex information around nutrition and health.
 Our nutrition knowledge scores capture information gathered over a long
 period, which would probably be prohibitively difficult to induce experimentall
y.
 Moreover, if the dependent variable reflects naturally-occurring decisions
 such as those in Homescan, this strategy would also require that the informatio
n provision is processed by all consumers, is remembered, and is salient
 at the time of choice—conditions that seem implausible outside a controlled,
 online shopping experiment as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Allcott2015"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 At the same time, a controlled online shopping experiment would not lead
 to plausible estimates of demand curves (and therefore bias) in our context,
 because SSBs are easy to purchase and these outside options would be perfect
 substitutes for the products in the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum, while our approach requires a strong unconfoundedness assumption
 and has other weaknesses, other possible approaches to estimating bias
 involve arguably stronger assumptions and are, in our view, even more likely
 to suffer from confounds.
 Moreover, and in contrast to the requirements of some other approaches,
 the dataset we use to estimate demand elasticities is essentially the same
 one we use for estimating bias—a key advantage for internal consistency.

 to estimate both the elasticities and the bias.
 We do this in two ways.
 First, we show that the estimating equations can be derived by log-linearizing
 the general utility function.
 This approach is in line with the sufficient statistics approach of much
 of the optimal tax literature, which considers only local variation of
 the parameters.
 Although the elasticities are not guaranteed to be globally constant, they
 are locally constant.
 The key assumption assumption for the log-linearized approximation to be
 a good one is that the empirical variation in prices and incomes that we
 consider is not too big.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our second approach, we show that our estimating equation can be derived
 from a CES utility function, using only the approximation that expenditures
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 are a negligibly small share of income.

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\bar{x}}=(\theta,\bar{z},y,\bar{p})$
\end_inset

 We assumed terms of order two or higher (with respect to price, bias, 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

) are negligible.
 Formally, we assume that for 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq2$

 is negligible.

 price 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{p}$

\end{align}

\end_inset

Since

 is a constant, we have the estimating equation used in the body of the

 In general, a sufficient condition is that

Because SSBs are storable, past prices and merchandising conditions that
 affect past purchases could in theory affect current stockpiles and thus
 current purchases.
 To address this, we estimate a version of Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:ElasticityEstimation"

\end_inset

 that includes lags of the price and merchandising condition variables.
 Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $l$

 index quarterly lags, we estimate the following regression: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln s_{it}=\sum_{l=0}^{L}\zeta_{l}\ln p_{i,t-l}+\sum_{l=0}^{L}\nu_{l}\boldsymbol{f}_{i,t-l}+\xi\ln z_{ct}+\omega_{t}+\mu_{ic}+\varepsilon_{it},\label{eq:ElasticityEstimation-Lags}

\end_inset

 is a powerful predictor of price paid in quarter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 but is not strongly conditionally correlated with prices paid in the quarters
 before and after.
 This implies that we have strong first stages and do not have large serial
 autocorrelation problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A standard approach to determining the optimal number of lags in a distributed
 lag model is to choose the specification that minimizes the Aikake Information
 Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).
 In essence, these criteria find the specification that best predicts purchases
 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 As shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceAndIncomeElasticity_IVLag"

\end_inset

, the specification that minimizes AIC and BIC is to set 
\begin_inset Formula $L=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 to include only contemporaneous quarter prices.
 Furthermore, the coefficients on lagged prices in the table are all statistical
ly zero, implying no statistically detectable stockpiling of SSBs from quarter
 to quarter.

\emph on
(6) I think the use of county income in equation (19) requires more caveats
 / robustness.
 First, the authors say they prefer this to self-reported income because
 self-reported income is measured with error and may not align with the
 relevant time period.
 But both of these things are true of county income as well.
 County income is clearly a noisy measure of any individual's income (and
 the residual component may be correlated w/ county income conditional on
 the controls), and county income is an average over the past year, which
 also may not align correctly.
 Moreover, county income could introduce other sources of bias: shocks to
 county income may be correlated with various market prices (e.g., availability
 of restuarants and restaurant prices, other grocery prices not captured
 in p_it, etc.); it may capture peer effects by which my consumption depends
 on what my friends are drinking; it may be correlated with other drivers
 of preferences like whether I am working vs.
 sitting at home watching football, etc.
 I think this is fine to use as a baseline, but these caveats should be
 emphasized and the authors should show robustness to using self-reported
 income and/or to instrumenting self-reported income with county income.

When estimating the income elasticity in Equation

 We think of Equation

\end_inset

 as the reduced form of an instrumental variable (IV) regression with time-varyi
ng household income as an endogenous variable and county mean income as
 an instrument, where the first stage should have a coefficient of one.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This approach would be biased if migration causes changes in county mean
 income that are correlated with within-household SSB demand changes and
 with income changes for continuing residents.
 However, migration is likely responsible for only a small share of year-to-year
 county income variation.
 Bias could also arise if county income changes are correlated with unobserved
 within-household preference changes, for example if high-socioeconomic
 status counties experience both faster income growth and faster declines
 in preferences for SSBs.
 However, Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ElasticityEstimates_Alt"

\end_inset

 shows that the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\xi}$
\end_inset

 is unaffected by controlling for a linear time trend in county sample average
 income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this appendix, we present alternative specifications using household
 income reported by Homescan households on annual surveys.
 There are several benefits to using the household-level instead of country-leve
l income data.
 First, there is substantially more variation to exploit, so the estimates
 can be more precise.
 Second, using county income can introduce other sources of bias, including
 that county income changes may be correlated with unobserved prices (such
 as for other grocery items and SSBs at restaurants) or other drivers of
 SSB preferences.
 Third, county average income changes may accrue disproportionately to household
s with high vs.
 low SSB demand or high vs.
 low incomes, which could bias the estimated income elasticity or the difference
 in income elasticity at high vs.
 low incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These concerns notwithstanding, we use county income for our primary estimates
 because there are three problems with the household-level income data.
 First, one might naturally expect more measurement error in the household-level
 survey data, especially because we are exploiting within-household variation.
 Second, using household-level income can generated additional endogeneity
 problems.
 In particular, changes in household composition (for example, a divorce
 or a adult moving in) can affect household income and the quantity of SSBs
 (and other groceries) purchased.
 Third, there is some uncertainty over the year for which Homescan panelists
 are reporting their income.
 The surveys reported for year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are taken in the fall of year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

.
 In the early years of the sample, panelists were asked to report total
 annual income as of year-end of the 
\emph on
previous
\emph default
 calendar year, i.e.
 year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

.
 Nielsen believes that panelists are actually reporting their annualized
 income at the time of the survey, and as of 2011, the instructions for
 income no longer mention the previous calendar year, but rather annualized
 income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ElasticityEstimates_Inc"

\end_inset

 explores this third issue by regressing the natural log of household income
 in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 on the natural log of current and lagged county mean income.
 The second lag of county income is most predictive, suggesting that the
 modal Homescan household is reporting their income for that year.
 However, other lags also have predictive power, suggesting that there will
 be some measurement error.
 The low t-statistics on county income also highlight that county income
 variation is not very predictive of reported household-level income variation.

 Column 1 reproduces the primary estimate from column 2 of Table

 Columns 2–5 substitute household income and the first and second lead of
 household income in place of county income.
 Across the various columns, the estimated income elasticities 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\xi}$

 range from 0 to about 0.04.
 This is substantially smaller than the estimate of

 One natural explanation is that the difference is attenuation bias driven
 by measurement error in household income.
 Even though the magnitudes differ, we emphasize that all income elasticity
 estimates 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\xi}$
\end_inset

 are consistent in their key qualitative implication: they all imply that
 the steeply declining consumption-income profile is not driven by year-to-year
 causal income effects.

 Panel (a) presents the quarterly average price (unweighted across stores

 Other than a nationwide price increase in early 2008, there is no clear
 pattern, illustrating that chains vary their prices independently of each
 other over time.
 Panel (b), by contrast, shows a clear pattern.
 This figure looks within one example retail chain, presenting the quarterly
 average price (again unweighted across weeks) for each store at that chain.
 The vertical patterns illustrate that this chain varies prices in a coordinated
 way across all of its stores.
 In mid-2008, for example, prices at all stores were relatively high, whereas
 in early 2007, prices at all stores were relatively low.

Measurement Error Correction for Bias Estimation

The variables

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are measured imperfectly, for two reasons.
 First, household head average biases and preferences are unobserved for
 two-head households in which only one head responded to the survey.
 Second, the PanelViews survey delivers bias 
\emph on
proxies
\emph default
 that may contain measurement error.
 This appendix details how we address these issues.
 For this appendix, we now distinguish between bias, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{b}_{i}$

, and the bias 
\emph on

 measured in the PanelViews survey, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{b}}_{i}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observed bias proxies are as follows.
 For two-head households, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{b}_{1si}$

 is the average of the primary shopper's self-control assessments for herself
 and the other head, and in the

 Moreover, the distribution of

The classical measurement error assumption for self-control could be violated
 in reality, for example if spouses are both unaware of biases, or if one
 spouse's preferences (e.g.
 that the other spouse would lose weight) both cause them to respond that
 the other spouse

 It is reasonable to make the approximation that nutrition knowledge is
 measured without error, because the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire
 is a many-question scale with high sensitivity to change and construct
 validity and a high test-retest reliability of 0.89

As introduced in Section

, the Homescan grocery purchase data are imperfect measures of SSB consumption,
 both because they do not measure away-from-home SSB consumption and because
 the Homescan data are at the household level, while the bias proxies from
 PanelViews are at the individual level.
 For a comprehensive measure of individual-level SSB consumption, we therefore
 delivered a beverage intake frequency questionnaire as part of the PanelViews
 survey.
 In this appendix, we describe these SSB consumption data and use them to
 estimate average marginal bias.

 non-SSBs (100% fruit juice and diet soft drinks).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does Homescan consumption compare to the self-reports? Because average
 SSB consumption is declining over time in the U.S., we make this comparison
 using only the most recent year of Homescan data (2016) for closest comparabili
ty with the 2017 PanelViews survey.
 In 2016, Homescan purchases average 
\begin_inset CommandInset include

At the individual household level, however, the two sources are not always
 consistent.
 The relationship between natural log of SSB purchases per adult equivalent
 in the most recent year of Homescan purchases and natural log of average
 self-reported SSB consumption per adult in the PanelViews survey has only

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Only some of this low 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 is from not having self-reports from the full household: when limiting
 to one-person households, the relationship has 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}\approx\input{../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/PVHMSR21.tex}$
\end_inset

.
 Some of the low 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 is from variation within households over time.
 The PanelViews self-reports are from October 2017, whereas the most recent
 year of Homescan data is 2016, and a regression of household-level Homescan
 SSB purchases on its one year lag has only 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}\approx\input{../../Output/Analysis/NumbersForText/HMSHMSR2.tex}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This relatively low value underscores the importance of having both consumption
 measures.
 Because each measure has different strengths (the PanelViews surveys are
 at the individual level, measure intake, and include consumption away from

Equivalent Variation and Welfare Calculations
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use the sufficient statistics discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"

\end_inset

 to approximate the change in welfare from the introduction of a sin tax.
 The net change in welfare is equal to the equivalent variation (measured
 under normative utility) of the sin tax, weighted by each consumer's welfare
 weight, plus the increase in tax revenues and externality reductions, measured
 in terms of public funds.
 We consider each in turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalent variation (EV) for a consumer of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is defined as the change in wealth which would alter normative utility
 by the same amount as the introduction of a given tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 For a small tax, this is equal to decision utility EV (the wealth change
 such that the consumer would express indifference between it and the introducti
on of the tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) plus the change in welfare due to internalities.
 We log-linearize demand around the (observed) no-tax equilibrium 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, so the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-earners under a tax 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}(z,t)=\bar{s}(z)\left(\frac{p+t}{p}\right)^{-\bar{\zeta}^{c}(z)}$
\end_inset

, and decision utility EV is approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{1-\zeta^{c}(\theta)}\left((p+t)\hat{s}(z,t)-p\bar{s}(z)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The welfare change due to internalities is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\theta)\cdot\left(\hat{s}(z,t)-\bar{s}(z)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The sum of these two figures gives the money-metric change in welfare for
 consumers earning 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Weighting this money-metric change by social marginal welfare weights (net
 of income effects, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}(z)$
\end_inset

), these welfare changes can be aggregated with the value of resulting tax
 revenues and reduced externalities (both measured in units of public funds)
 to approximate the total change in welfare from the tax, accounting for
 distributional concerns.

One may also be interested in the welfare gains which would be realized
 under various suboptimal SSB tax policies.
 We consider two in particular.
 First, consider the modal policy among U.S.
 cities which have passed SSB taxes: a tax of one cent per ounce.
 Under our baseline parameter estimates, this lower-than-optimal tax would
 generate a welfare gain of $
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/dwonecenttax.tex"

\end_inset

per person, or $
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/dwPoponecenttax.tex"

\end_inset

billion across the population—implying that the loss from this sub-optimal
 policy rather than the optimum is approximately $
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../../Output/Simulations/NumbersForText/dwLossonecenttax.tex"

\end_inset

million annually.
 Second, consider a policy maker who mistakenly believes consumers are unbiased
 and who therefore implements the

\end_inset

 optimal tax estimate from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

, when in fact our estimates of bias are accurate.
 The resulting welfare gains from this suboptimal tax are only $
\begin_inset CommandInset include

per person per year, or $

 These results emphasize the importance of accounting for behavioral biases

\begin_layout Subsection
Functional Form Specifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the simulations to follow, we employ the following functional form for
 utility:
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
U(c,s,z;\theta) & =c+\overbrace{v(s,c,\theta)}^{\text{SSB subutility}}-\overbrace{\Psi\left(z/w(\theta)\right)}^{\text{Effort cost}}\label{eq:sims U}\\
V(c,s,z;\theta) & =c+v(s,c,\theta)-\Psi\left(z/w(\theta)\right)-\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)s\label{eq:sims V}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\size default
We consider two different specifications for 
\begin_inset Formula $v(s,c,\theta)$
\end_inset

, to explore the robustness of these results to particular assumptions about
 functional forms.
 The first is 
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v(s,c,\theta)=a(c)b(\theta)\left(\frac{s^{1-k(\theta)}}{1-k(\theta)}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

An attractive feature of this functional form is that there is type-specific
 constant compensated price elasticity of demand, equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta^{c}(\theta)=1/k(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 (This may vary across types.) However a disadvantage of it is that it doesn't
 technically accommodate a strict present bias interpretation, since the
 bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 cannot be mapped into a specific value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 To allow for this possibility, we employ a different functional form for
 our second specification:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v(s,c,\theta)=a(c)b(\theta)\left(\frac{s^{1-k(\theta)}}{1-k(\theta)}\right)-\iota(\theta)s.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota(\theta)+\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as the long run money-metric health costs of SSB consumption
, of which the present biased agent internalizes 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota(\theta)$
\end_inset

, accounting for only a share 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(\theta)=\frac{\iota(\theta)}{\iota(\theta)+\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)}$
\end_inset

, when making consumption decisions.
 (This second functional form does not feature constant compensated elasticities
—instead, the elasticity rises with price.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both specifications, the product 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)b(\theta)$
\end_inset

 controls the level of soda consumption, and can be calibrated nonparametrically
 using the observed cross-income profile of SSB consumption.
 The components 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(\theta)$
\end_inset

 control whether that cross-sectional variation is driven by income effects
 or preference heterogeneity, respectively.
 We can nonparametrically calibrate 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

 to generate the income elasticity estimated from our data, and we attribute
 the residual cross-sectional SSB variation to preference heterogeneity.

The term 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\theta)$
\end_inset

 controls the marginal internality from SSB consumption.
 If some SSB variation is due to income effects (non-constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

), then normative utility in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 is not quasilinear in numeraire consumption, and so

 is not exactly equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U'_{s}}{U'_{c}}-\frac{V'_{s}}{V'_{c}}$

 to calibrate the pre- and post-tax income distributions for the United

 We use their reported distribution for 2014, which includes percentiles

 Each of these points in the income distribution is treated as an individual
 point in a discretized ability grid for the purposes of simulation.

 this is inconsistent with the calibrated profile of soda consumption.

An alternative approach would be to use estimated effective marginal tax

 However since these estimates often omit some types of taxes, and fail
 to include many types of benefits, we have chosen to use the more comprehensive
 notion of taxes and benefits from

 Following

 We compute these weights using the status quo U.S.

 To interpolate consumption across the full ability distribution in our

 to each income point in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The price elasticity of SSB demand,

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 We calibrate the uncompensated SSB elasticity and the SSB income effect
 as a linear functions of net income, using the interaction terms for elasticity
 and income effects with household reported in Column (5) of Table

 Since the interaction terms are estimated to be negative in our data, we
 place floors on these values (0.5 for the uncompensated elasticity, and
 0 for the income effect) to avoid values inconsistent with theory at high
 incomes.
 We then use these calibrated values to compute the compensated elasticity
 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta^{c}(\theta)$

In the second structural specification, we must also calibrate the health

 is a 20% permanent reduction of SSB consumption, whereas we are interested
 in the QALY cost of each SSB consumed.
 To reach this, we first compute the approximate total QALYs gained from
 reducing SSB consumption for a single year.
 If the 10-year total of 0.00278 QALYs were composed of 10 years of exposure
 to the effects of a 20% reduction during year 1, 9 years of exposure from
 the reduction during year 2, etc., then the first year's reduction would
 account for 
\begin_inset Formula $10/55=0.18$
\end_inset

 of the 10 year total, or 0.00051 QALYs.
 This accounts only for the QALY difference in the first 10 years.
 If the per-year effect were the same in the ensuing years (a conservative
 assumption, given that health costs typically compound later in life),
 then this ten-year effect should be multiplied by four, given a median
 US age of 38 and life expectancy of 78.
 This yields a total approximate effect of 0.0021 QALYs for a one-year 20%
 SSB reduction.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This translates to $105 per person using the commonly used conservative
 estimate of $50,000 for the value of a QALY

 estimates imply that on average, people consume 5475 oz of SSBs per year
 which implies that a 20% reduction would reduce consumption by 1095 oz.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Although these marginal health costs are likely to be heterogeneous in
 practice, for purposes of this calibration we assume they are constant
 across the population, so that

 per ounce for all consumers.
 Using our estimates of bias from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:BiasEffects"

, this implies that 5% to 15% of health costs are uninternalized due to
 present bias and/or incorrect beliefs.

We jointly calibrate the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(\theta)$
\end_inset

 nonparametrically to match both the level of SSB consumption (across the
 income distribution) and the estimated SSB income elasticity, using the
 following procedure.
 We first assume 
\begin_inset Formula $a'(c)=0$
\end_inset

, and we calibrate the product 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)b(\theta)$
\end_inset

 at each point in the income distribution—without yet worrying about the
 decomposition into separate terms—to match the observed schedule of SSB
 consumption via the first-order condition for SSB consumption.
 We then compute a path of 
\begin_inset Formula $a'(c)$
\end_inset

 which is consistent with our estimated SSB income elasticities, and we
 numerically integrate to find 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

, which in turn identifies 
\begin_inset Formula $b(\theta)$
\end_inset

 at each ability gridpoint.
 Finally, we compute the implied ability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $w(\theta)$
\end_inset

 which generates the observed income distribution.
 We then repeat this procedure with the new 
\begin_inset Formula $a'(c)$
\end_inset

 (which affects the FOC for SSB demand) and we iterate to convergence.
 In this manner, we find a non-parametric schedule of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(\theta)$
\end_inset

 which is consistent with both the level of estimated soda consumption at
 each income, and with the estimated SSB income elasticities in our data.
 During simulations, we compute the nonparametric function 
\begin_inset Formula $a(c)$
\end_inset

 using linear interpolation (extrapolation) over 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(c)$

Simulation Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our structural model estimates for the optimal SSB tax are presented in
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SimulationResults"

\end_inset

.
 As in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

, for each specification we report the optimal SSB tax under two income
 tax regimes.
 First, we compute the optimal SSB tax holding fixed the income tax at the
 current status quo, under the assumption that SSB tax revenues are distributed
 equally across all consumers as a lump-sum payment.
 Second, we jointly solve for the optimal income tax, which may be quite
 different from the U.S.
 status quo.
 The former exercise is most relevant if the SSB tax is viewed as an isolated
 policy over which policymakers much make choices, independent of overall
 income tax reforms.
 The latter is more relevant as an illustration of the theoretical results
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"

\end_inset

, which follow the tradition in the optimal taxation literature of jointly
 characterizing optimal income and commodity taxes.
 To illustrate the difference between these two regimes, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SimulationIncomeTax"

\end_inset

 plots the mapping between pre- vs.
 post-tax income in the U.S.
 status quo and under the simulated optimal income tax.

The Optimal Sweetened Beverage Tax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SimulationResults"

\end_inset

 computes estimates for each of the specifications from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

 using this structural model.
 The values in the first column (under the prevailing income tax) are quantitati
vely very close to the sufficient statistics computations from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

.
 The values in the second column (computed under the optimal income tax)
 generate the same qualitative patterns, but they are generally lower than
 the values in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:OptTaxResults"

\end_inset

 under the optimal income tax.
 This is driven primarily by the endogenous change in SSB consumption generated
 by the income tax reform in the structural model.
 Recall that the sufficient statistics formula (under the optimal income
 tax) is computed using the 
\emph on
observed
\emph default
 profile of soda consumption, whereas in the structural model, the tax is
 computed accounting to the change in consumption due to the income tax
 reform.
 The optimal income tax substantially raises the net income of the lowest
 earning households (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SimulationIncomeTax"

\end_inset

) and, since SSB income effects are positive, this raises the amount of
 SSB consumption among low earners.
 Therefore, the demand response to a tax, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ds}{dt}$
\end_inset

, is substantially larger in magnitude at low incomes in the structural
 model than is accounted for in the sufficient statistics calculation, and
 as a result, bias correction progressivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is accordingly higher in the structural model, implying a larger corrective
 motive and hence a higher optimal tax.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
How the Optimal Internality-Correcting Tax Varies with Elasticity and Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rows in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SimulationResults"

\end_inset

 are intended to represent realistic alternative specifications for the
 purpose of understanding the robustness of our estimates.
 However, one might also wish to understand how more extreme variations
 in parameters affect the optimal sin tax.
 In particular, the analytic formulas in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"

\end_inset

 emphasize the role of bias and elasticity of demand in determining the
 optimal tax.
 In order to illustrate those insights quantitatively, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Simulation"

\end_inset

 plots the optimal sin tax across a range of values of bias and elasticities
 of demand.
 To isolate the role of the bias and elasticity of demand, the simulations
 in this figure assume constant values of each parameter across the income
 distribution (akin to row 10 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SimulationResults"

\end_inset

), and zero externality cost.
 As a result, the optimal tax in the absence of distributional concerns
 (i.e., the optimal Pigouvian tax) lies on the 45-degree line, and departures
 from that line illustrate the effect of redistributive concerns on the
 optimal sin tax.
 The baseline (average) value of bias is represented in the figure by the
 vertical dashed line, and the baseline (average) demand elasticity is plotted
 by the red line.
 All values are computed holding fixed the status quo U.S.
 income tax.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Simulation"

\end_inset

 illustrates an important theoretical insight from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, the regressivity costs term (which reduces the optimal SSB
 tax) rises with the demand elasticity.
 Quantitatively, these costs are modest for elasticities in the range estimated
 in our data, and the optimal SSB tax lies close to (although distinctly
 below) the 45 degree line representing the optimal Pigouvian tax.
 However at lower elasticity values, regressivity costs become large.
 Indeed at a low elasticity value of 0.25, the optimal SSB tax is in fact
 a subsidy for the average bias computed in our data.
